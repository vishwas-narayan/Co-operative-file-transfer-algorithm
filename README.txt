# CFT: Co-operative file transfer algorithm for multi network interface sessions

### Abstract: File transfer is one of the important operations on the Internet. Generally files are transferred from one machine to another machine through one interface. File transfer can occur through multiple interface connections also. Protocols such as SCTP, transfers data in multiple data stream within a single connection and LFTP transfers file sourced from multiple servers to a single host. Here, we present the concept of using multiple network interfaces for transferring files from a single server. This would ensure the utilization of combined bandwidth of all the interfaces used, so that the rate of file transfer would increase considerably compared to single bandwidth transfer. In this work, we use two interfaces i.e, IEEE 802.3(Ethernet) and IEEE 802.11(WiFi) to accomplish the above task. We use a non pre-emptive context switching framework Twisted where threading is avoided for an effective resource utilization. The required file is downloaded utilizing two interfaces instead of one unlike normal file transfer. We analyze the improvement in performance by observing the time taken to download a file using two different interfaces (Ethernet andWiFi) and comparing that with a single interface download (using either Ethernet or WiFi) in real time scenario. We attempt to deal with the issue of when and how to connect through two interfaces which combines the bandwidths of both these interfaces, aiding in improving the performance of file transfer when compared to file transfer using single interface.
